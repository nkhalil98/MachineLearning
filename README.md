# Machine Learning Projects

## Models
- Simple Linear Regression:
  - Predicting Canada's adjusted net national income per capita (current US$). The most recent dataset that includes many more countries can be found on: https://api.worldbank.org/v2/en/indicator/NY.ADJ.NNTY.PC.CD?downloadformat=csv.
  - Implementing gradient descent.
- Multiple Linear Regression:
  - Predicting employee salary based on years of expreience, interview score, and online test score.
  - Predicting car price based on model, milage, and age.
- Logistic Regression:
  - Predicting employee retention based on multiple factors. The dataset can be found on Kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/giripujar/hr-analytics.
  - Classifying flower type (Setosa - Versicolour - Virginica) from scikit-learn Iris dataset.
- Decision Tree:
  - Predicting passenger survival in Titanic. The dataset can be found on Kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data?select=train.csv.
- Support Vector Machine (SVM):
  - Classifying digits from scikit-learn Digits dataset.
